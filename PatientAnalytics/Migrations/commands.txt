Whenever a database table/ model is updated we should create a new migration to track the changes.  To do this, issue this command:

`dotnet ef migrations add {descriptive_migration_name}`

To apply migrations to the database issue this command:

`dotnet ef database update`

When doing this for the first time you should start with an empty database.  


To revert all database migrations you can run:
`dotnet ef database update 0`


Running the InitialCreate migration will add an initial Super Admin user with the username "superadmin".  
The password for this user will be logged to the console at the end of the InitialCreate migration.
