## How to run this project locally?

### Step 1: Install .NET 8 SDK
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0

This project is developed on .NET version 8.0.204.

[How to check if .NET is already installed?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/how-to-detect-installed-versions?pivots=os-windows)

Check the current version of .NET runtime with the following command on the project's root directory.

`dotnet --version`

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install dependencies with the following command on the project's root directory.

`dotnet restore`

### Step 3: Install Entity Framework Core Tools to .NET Core CLI
Install Entity Framework Core tools globally to enable the .NET Core CLI to perform design-time development tasks.

`dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`

Verify installation with the following command.

`dotnet ef`

### Step 4: Setup Postgres Database Connection
For this example we will be a generating a Postgres database via Docker.

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Retrieve the [Postgres Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) and start a postgres instance

> To establish connection with credentials as found on appsettings.json, run the following command: 
> `docker run --name patientanalytics-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres`

3. Establish connection with database via your preferred IDE

### Step 5: Migrate the Database
Run the following command within the `PatientAnalytics` directory of the project to execute database migration.

`dotnet ef database update`

On completion of database migration, search the terminal outputs and locate an output with the following format.

`Initial Super Admin account created with username: superadmin and password: <auto-generated-password>`

Make a note of the auto-generated SuperAdmin login credentials as indicated on the terminal. 
This is vital for the creation of new SuperAdmins, Admins and Doctors to interact with the application.

### Step 6: Start the Application
Run the following command within the `PatientAnalytics` directory of the project to start the application.

`dotnet run --project PatientAnalytics.csproj`

### Step 7: Interact with the Swagger Documentation
Direct to the following URL to view and interact with the Swagger Documentation for Web APIs. 
Swagger Documentation is automatically generated on build the application, and initially on run the project locally.

http://localhost:5272/swagger

### Step 8: Interact with the Blazor App
Direct to the following URL to view and interact with the frontend Blazor Web App.
Web App is automatically compiled on build the application, and initially on run the project locally.

http://localhost:5272

### Step 9: Login with the Auto-generated SuperAdmin via the Blazor App
Use the auto-generated login credentials provided on Step 4 to gain access to the SuperAdmin portal.
- Login to the SuperAdmin portal allows the creation and management of SuperAdmins, Admins and Doctors.
- Login to the Admin portal allows the creation and management of Admins and Doctors.
- Login to the Doctor portal allows the creation and management of Patients, and inputs of patient's metrics to generate reports.

### Step 10: Run Unit Tests
Run the following command within the `PatientAnalytics.Tests` directory of the project to run the unit tests.

`dotnet test`
